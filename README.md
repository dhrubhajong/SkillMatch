# Problem Statement
The SkillMatch database and Power BI report aim to address the following challenges and provide streamlined processes for the management team:

1. Lack of Visibility: Currently, there is limited visibility into each student's progress on a regular basis, making it difficult to track their skill development and identify areas of improvement.

2. Manual Data Management: The existing data management process is time-consuming and prone to errors. It involves manual entry and maintenance of student records, progress data, and placement information.

3. Timely Placements: The placement team faces challenges in placing students on the stipulated time due to a lack of real-time insights into their progress and readiness for industry roles.

4. Scholarship Disbursement: The finance team needs accurate performance data to disburse scholarships based on merit and achievement. The current process lacks a standardized and data-driven approach for determining scholarship eligibility.

# Objectives
The SkillMatch project aims to achieve the following objectives:

1. Provide a centralized database to store student information, progress data, placements, and scholarships.

2. Develop a Power BI report that offers visualizations and analytics to track and analyze student progress, identify trends, and assess readiness for placements.

3. Streamline data management processes, ensuring data accuracy, consistency, and ease of access.

4. Enable the placement team to make informed decisions by providing real-time insights into student performance and readiness for industry roles.

5. Facilitate the finance team in accurately assessing scholarship eligibility based on performance metrics and distributing scholarships accordingly.

By addressing these challenges and achieving the objectives, the SkillMatch project will empower the management team to make data-driven decisions, track student progress effectively, streamline operations, and support timely placements and scholarship disbursement.
